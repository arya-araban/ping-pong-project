This was my BSc degree project, which included working with a team of students and professors (around 20 people) to create a real life ping-pong playing robot

I was tasked as the computer vision leader of the project for around 7 months, and was able to achieve many of the vision tasks that were needed for this project.

these include: 
- Tracking the ping-pong ball and getting its real world locations in each frame 
- Getting the speed of the ping-pong ball in each frame
- Plotting the trajectory of the moving ping-pong ball 
- Predicting the ball's movement based on the trajectory 
- Tracking the ping-pong racket with markers, and getting the Euler angles of the racket in each frame.
